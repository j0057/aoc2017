# Advent of Code 2017

My solutions to [AoC2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017). I chose to build them
in Python 3.5, because that is what's installed on WSL.

## Getting started

Install the requirements:

    python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt

(Or do it in a virtualenv)

## Run the tests

Run the tests once:

    pytest

Or everytime the code changes on disk:

    ptw
